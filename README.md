## Overview
The Detection Fake News in Online project is a machine learning-based application designed to identify and classify fake news articles. This project aims to combat misinformation by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze text and predict its authenticity.<br>

## Features
<br>Text Analysis: Utilizes NLP to process and analyze the text of news articles.
<br>Classification Model: Implements machine learning algorithms to classify articles as real or fake.
<br>User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input news articles and receive immediate feedback on their authenticity.
<br>Data Visualization: Displays the results with clear visualizations to help users understand the predictions and model performance.
<br>Dataset Utilization: Trains the model on publicly available datasets for effective learning.
## Technologies Used
<br>Programming Language: Python
<br>Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK (or SpaCy), Matplotlib
<br>Machine Learning: Various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
