## Overview
The Detection Fake News in Online project is a machine learning-based application designed to identify and classify fake news articles. This project aims to combat misinformation by utilizing natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to analyze text and predict its authenticity.

## Features
Text Analysis: Utilizes NLP to process and analyze the text of news articles.<br>
Classification Model: Implements machine learning algorithms to classify articles as real or fake.<br>
User Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input news articles and receive immediate feedback on their authenticity.<br>
Data Visualization: Displays the results with clear visualizations to help users understand the predictions and model performance.<br>
Dataset Utilization: Trains the model on publicly available datasets for effective learning.<br>

## Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
NLTK (or SpaCy)
Matplotlib
Machine Learning: Various classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)

## Methodology
Data Collection: Gather data from publicly available datasets containing labeled news articles.<br>
Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data, including tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words.<br>
Feature Extraction: Use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text data into numerical representations.<br>
Model Training: Train various machine learning models on the processed dataset.<br>
Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.<br>
Deployment: Implement a user-friendly interface to allow users to input news articles and receive classification results.<br>

## Future Work
Enhance the model by incorporating deep learning techniques.<br>
Expand the dataset to include more diverse news sources.<br>
Develop a mobile application for broader accessibility.<br>
